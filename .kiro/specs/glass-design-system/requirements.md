# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Loft golf swing analysis application needs a consistent button design system to standardize the appearance and behavior of interactive elements. The system should distinguish between two types of glass effects based on their context: glass buttons for elements on webcam panels and frosted glass buttons for elements on replay interfaces.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a consistent glass button design system, so that all buttons throughout the application follow the same visual patterns.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a button is on a webcam panel THEN the system SHALL apply a glass effect style
2. WHEN a button is on a replay interface THEN the system SHALL apply a frosted glass effect style
3. WHEN implementing buttons THEN the system SHALL provide reusable components for both button types
4. IF a button needs custom styling THEN the system SHALL allow for customization while maintaining the core glass aesthetic

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want clear guidelines for when to use each button type, so that the application maintains visual consistency.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN designing a new interface THEN the system SHALL provide clear rules for which button type to use
2. WHEN adding buttons to webcam panels THEN the system SHALL use the glass button style
3. WHEN adding buttons to replay interfaces THEN the system SHALL use the frosted glass button style
4. IF a button exists outside these contexts THEN the system SHALL provide guidance on which style to apply
